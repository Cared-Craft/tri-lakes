# Leadership Academy

Leadership Academy teaches GSBOR members new skills they can use in their business and in their personal lives. It gives them a taste of leadership at the local association level and insight into possible involvement at the State and National Association levels. It is designed with the intention to cultivate future leaders for committees and, eventually, the Board of Directors.

GSBOR Leadership Academy was launched in 2018, modeled after Leadership Academies at Missouri REALTORS® and the National Association of REALTORS®. Those long-running programs have yielded impressive results, as witnessed by Missouri REALTORS® data.
