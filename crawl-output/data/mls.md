If the agent has a listing in mls, click on the Report Violation button, which is located at the top right of the screen in the additional menu dropdown.

If the violation has to do with a lockbox, sign in the yard, advertising on social media, etc. send an email to support@somomls.com with a photo or screenshot of the violation.

Please check the MLS RULES before submitting a violation report.

See NAR’s website for more information on the code of ethics.

Some violations, such as breaches of Clear Cooperation are not tied to an MLS listing. It is best to submit these types of violations directly to MLS admins and provide adequate verification.  Other rules violations not directly tied to listing data may also need to be reported from time to time. For these types of violations, please complete the Online MLS Violation Reporting Form.  Please do NOT use this form to report listing data errors. Listing information needing correction should be reported from the listing report, using the ‘Report Error’ button.
