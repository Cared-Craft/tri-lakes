## Membership

Membership is granted to all applicants for REALTOR® membership upon submission of the following paperwork (subject to final approval by the Board of Directors of the Greater Springfield Board of REALTORS®):

*If your license is active at the Missouri Real Estate Commission, under a qualifying broker that holds membership at GSBOR, you have up to 30 days to join from your license active date.*

## New Member Applications

If you are a new agent joining Greater Springfield Board of REALTORS® or you are changing Associations and Greater Springfield Board of REALTORS® is your ONLY Association, fill out a primary application. This applies for REALTORS® and Appraisers.
