# Education - Greater Springfield Board of Realtors

## EDUCATION PROGRAMS

### C2EX

GSBOR supports the National Association of REALTORS® educational program “Commitment to Excellence” with peer-to-peer advice, counsel, and mentoring as students complete this series of action-oriented training.

### CODE OF ETHICS

The National Association of REALTORS® requires members to complete Code of Ethics training every three years. In addition to the online solution provided by NAR, GSBOR provides classroom education to ensure members are up to date on this requirement, and the latest changes in the Code from period to period, usually with continuing education credit.

### CONTINUING EDUCATION

To assist members in the requirement for 12 classroom hours of continuing education every two years, GSBOR strives to bring in high-level and engaging speakers and trainers to provide current and topical training.

### GSBOR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM

As of 2021, GSBOR now offers its own specialized certifications, allowing members to promote their knowledge and experience in areas such as Fair Housing, New Construction, and beyond.

### DESIGNATIONS

Continual growth and development is a critical part of being a REALTOR®, and adding specialized designations to one’s name recognizes that growth. GSBOR also offers a diverse line-up of designation-related class sessions to facilitate those designations.

If you need more information about continuing education courses, hours or policies, email support@gsbor.com for assistance.
