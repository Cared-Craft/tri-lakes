## Web Accessibility Help

There are actions you can take to adjust your web browser to make your web experience more accessible.

If you have trouble seeing web pages, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)(link is external) offers tips for optimizing(link is external) your computer and browser to improve your online experience.

If you find a keyboard or mouse difficult to use, speech recognition software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking may help you navigate web pages and online services. This software allows the user to move focus around a web page or application screen through voice controls.

If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there are several accessibility features available to you.

### Transcripts

A text transcript is a text equivalent of audio information that includes spoken words and non-spoken sounds such as sound effects. NAR is working on adding transcripts to all scripted video and audio content.

### Captioning

A caption is transcription for the audio track of a video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio tracks. Captions are generally rendered visually by being superimposed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio (e.g., when in a crowded room). Most of NAR’s video content includes captions. Learn how to turn captioning on and off in YouTube

### Volume controls

Your computer, tablet, or mobile device has volume control features. Each video and audio service has its own additional volume controls. Try adjusting both your device’s volume controls and your media players’ volume controls to optimize your listening experience.
