## MEMBERSHIP FAQ

Dues Calculator

Agents cannot cancel membership without written instruction from the broker. Your broker will need to send an email to support@gsbor.com and include a copy of the MREC form or written instruction to cancel.

There is not an option to put a membership on hold. You can only join or cancel your membership.

Your broker will need to submit a copy of the MREC license change form to the Board AFTER it has been sent certified mail to MREC. MREC will charge a $50.00 license change fee that will need to accompany the license. The Board also charges a $50.00 transfer fee to update all your member/MLS records. Please make sure to notify the board of additional contact information changes such as name, address, phone or email address.

Update Information

You can pay your dues online through the “pay bill” option. Please note: Payments must BE MADE by January 31st to avoid the $50.00 late fee.

Renewal invoices are posted online to your GSBOR account. The first notice will go out in mid-December. Dues are payable as of January 1st and late as of February 1st.

Teams are created under the direction of your Designated Broker and do not factor into Board membership. This means there is not a “team” membership option; it is only on an individual basis.

No, sharing of any login credentials between members is strictly prohibited.

No, there are no refunds on Board dues and application fees.
